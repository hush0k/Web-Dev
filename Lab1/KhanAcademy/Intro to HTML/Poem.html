<h1>Black Of My Eye</h1>
<p>Black of my eye <br>
    Frame of my mind <br>
    Drink never dry <br>
    Love of my Life <br> <br>

    Parting is winter, your absence is sorrow <br>
    I wish to stay until the morrow <br>
    Between your fair arms <br>
    when the nightingale sings, "Terrow" <br>

    The corners of your eyes <br>
    sparkle and they glisten <br>
    when you speak your solid words <br>
    everyone will listen <br> <br>

    Black of my eye <br>
    Frame of my mind <br>
    Drink never dry <br>
    Love of my Life</p>
