<h2 id="first">First day in KBTU</h2>
<p>The first day at <strong>KBTU</strong> was both exciting and overwhelming. The campus buzzed with energy as students gathered for orientation. I met new people, explored the facilities, and received an introduction to university life. It was a mix of nervousness and curiosity, but overall, it felt like the start of a great journey.</p>



<h2 id="second">Joining to Tumar orchestra</h2>
<p>Joining the <em>"Tumar"</em> orchestra was a thrilling experience. I was welcomed by talented musicians and quickly became immersed in the rhythm of rehearsals. As a conductor, I felt both honored and nervous, but the atmosphere was supportive. It was the beginning of an incredible musical journey filled with growth.</p>
